🏏 **IPL Winner Predictor**

An end-to-end machine learning web application that predicts the winner of an Indian Premier League (IPL) match based on the competing teams. The project combines data preprocessing, model training, and an interactive Streamlit-based user interface for real-time predictions.


🚀 **Project Overview**

The IPL Winner Predictor uses historical IPL match data to train a supervised machine learning model that learns patterns from past matches. Users can select two teams through a clean and intuitive web interface, and the system predicts the most likely winner.

This project is designed to demonstrate:-

*Practical application of machine learning

*Clean ML pipeline design

*Model deployment using Streamlit

*UI-focused ML applications

🧠 **Machine Learning Approach**

Algorithm Used:- _Random Forest Classifier_

Features:-

->Team 1

->Team 2

Target Variable:- _Match winner_

->Encoding Technique: _One-hot encoding_

->Frameworks & Libraries:-

**scikit-learn**

pandas

The model is trained once and cached to ensure fast predictions during runtime.


🛠️ **Tech Stack**

->Programming Language: Python

->Web Framework: Streamlit

->Machine Learning: scikit-learn

->Data Processing: pandas
